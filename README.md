2- what is different between authorization and authentication ?
**Authentication**
First and foremost, a system needs to validate users as they attempt to access the system. This is usually initiated by filling in the username and password fields. Beyond that, the site might send a one-time password (OTP) to confirm it is truly a valid user trying to sign in.
In fact, as web hosting company IONOS puts it, “more and more online services are beginning to use two-factor authentication, especially when it comes to sensitive data.” This is due, in large part, to the fact that so many passwords have been compromised over the years”.

**Authorization**
After users are authenticated, authorization is a matter of determining what level of access authenticated users should have. For instance, the system admin of a web application has typically more access than a regular user.
